# Refactor VBA code and measure performance
## Overview of Project
### Refactoring a VBA code to reduce the execusion time of the original code. The code in question automizes the calculation of the anual volume and the anual return per stock in a particular(s) year(s). These indicators help to bring some insights about stocks performance and trends. At the same time, this project intends to outline some advantages and disadvantages of code refactoring.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- In the instruction number 4 of Deliverable 2 a pivot table was used to simplify the filtering needed to apply function COUNTIFS. com%2FConnectime4ever%2Fkickstarter-analysis%2Fmain%2FKickstarter_Challenge.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)
- Trying to comeup with an insight based on Graph Outcomes Based on Goals. It is visually difficult to read the story and could be confussing.

## Summary
### Advantages of refactoring Code in general
- The code runs facter, which could be critical, especially when dealing with great amount of data.
- The refactoring changes the structure of the code making it more organized.
- The code looks more clean and uses less computer memory.
- The will still work if data changes.
- **All in all, the code will be more efficient.**
      
### Disadvantages of refactoring Code in general
- The refactoring can be very time-consuming.  That is why it has to be assed very carefuly if the time and energy that it implies worth it for the incremental efficiency and the importance of the code in the big picture.
- The refactoring does not add a new functionality. 
- One of the major disadvanges is the risk of adding bugs to a code that was already working. That is why is it so important to test the refactored code to make sure it will work. That takes time. 

### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored code. 
- The main advantages of the refactoring of this project in particular are: the dramatic reduction of the execution time of the code, and the flexibility the refactored code brings so the continuity of the code use. 
- The execution time might not be consistent. It was observed that the more the code is run it tends to run faster.
